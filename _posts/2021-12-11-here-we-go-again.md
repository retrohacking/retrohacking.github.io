Welcome back to my website! New year is coming, and with it also my new blog.
<!--excerpt-->

I used to have a website on Wordpress, but I decided to move to github pages since it gives me the possibility to customize my site as I want and I also had opportunity to begin to develop some web stuff by myself. I have big ideas for the new year and I thinkg i will put them here as I progress.

## Where did I start?

I started at the beginning of 2020, on [this website](https://retro4hack.wordpress.com) (hope I won't delete it so soon) because I wanted to share my experience in the world of programming and Cybersecurity. I have read my first post right now and I cannot believe how many progresses I have done, how many knowledges I have acquired and how many I will gain in the future.

When I started my Wordpress blog I was a complete beginner in Cybersecurity things, and had a discrete knowledge about programming languages like Python and C. Now I attend CTFs with my academic team and I have many more experience than when I began. What I like the most is Reverse Engineering, but EVERY SINGLE category of this world is of interest for me.  
From now on, all my experiences will be shared here so I hope you will follow it and I also hope that you can learn something from my successed and mistakes too.

I will end my post as I ended the first one on the old blog:  
*If you’re interested you can know something [about me](about), or you can even [contact me](contact). I’m really open to any comment, and collaboration!
Let’s start this journey!*
