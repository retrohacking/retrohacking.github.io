## >whoami

I'm just an Italian penetration tester in love with technology, and really really curious about everything.<br /><br />I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technologies for Software Production (Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro) and a M.Sc in Cybersecurity (Università di Roma-La Sapienza).<br /><br />I'd like to work forever in the world of hacking.

**What are my current abilities?**

I can work with C, C++, C#, Python and Java so I also had the possibility to approach Android Apps development.

Lately I've been working with disassemblers and debuggers like IDA, Ghidra, gdb, that are used for the activities of reverse egineering.

I can work on Windows and Linux.

In a hacking and CTF context I feel more comfortable with Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation: but I never lose the opportunity to learn something concerning the other categories like Web Exploitation, Crypto and Forensics. I also have fun with TryHackMe and HackTheBox and attend many CTFs with my Academic Team [Hackappatoi](https://hackappatoi.github.io/).

I’m really available to collaborate and work with with someone! Every experience is precious! So if you want to ask me anything or to propose any project just [contact me](contact.md).
