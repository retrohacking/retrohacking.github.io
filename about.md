| Just an Italian boy in love with technology, and really really curious about everything. | ![](/img/retro.jpg)

Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technologies for Software Production.
Currently studying Cybersecurity: want to work forever in coding and hacking.

**What are my current abilities?**
I can work with C, C++, C#, Python and Java so I also had they possibility to approach Android Apps development.
Lately I've been working with disassemblers and debuggers like IDA, Ghidra, gdb, that are used for the activities of reverse egineering.
I can work on Windows and Linux.
In a hacking and CTF context I feel more confortable with Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation: but I never lose the opportunity to learn something concerning the other categories like Web Exploitation, Crypto and Forensics.

At the moment I'm really into my studies but I've fun with TryHackMe and HackTheBox and attend many CTFs with my Academic Team [Hackappatoi](https://hackappatoi.github.io/)
Iâ€™m really available to collaborate and work with with someone! Every experience is precious! So:
Want to ask me anything or to propose any project? Just [contact me](contact.md).
