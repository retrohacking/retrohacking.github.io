For this CTF we are provided with 2 files: an executable called WiRE-client.exe and a file containing some collected packets called WiRE.pcapng. 
<!--excerpt-->

While opening the executable we cannot have any immediate clue about what is its purpose, we surely know that it is possible to open the pcapng file with a software like Wireshark.

It is sufficient to follow the TCP stream to see a strange message take shape:

```
..5"bt.vxgt.|t.w}pv.w~c.z.c..}rew.|h.utpc.btcgtc....4..Jb.rc.eni.cnctb.}g.unv..un{.s.L
```

that is clearly a crypted string. It is now that we begin to analyze the Client we're provided with.

![](/img/wire/error.png)

As we can see it requires a connection on port 9905... nothing that a netcat couldn't solve! Let's start it and we'll see it i a communication client server, where a kind of cryptography is applied to the messages:

![](/img/wire/crypto.png)

So let's try to send the string we found before to the server:

![](/img/wire/solution.png)

We can see familiar characters: we can infer something like:

> PLEASE GIVE ME FLAG FOR K3RN3LCTF MY DEAR SERVER

and right after this some characters between curly brackets; we can see that the E and the O are correctly interpreted by the client, so the missing characters must be 3 and 0. In the end adding a ! at the end like most of the flags we get the answer:

> S3CR3T_X0R_RES0LV3D_G00D_J0B!

The flag is in the format flag{...} so the flag we get is:

flag{S3CR3T_X0R_RES0LV3D_G00D_J0B!}
